    <p>The changes to account balances are due to FUND spent, staking rewards explicitly withdrawn, deposits spent or

    <p>Negative accrued rewards are rewards
        that have been withdrawn, and will reflect as a positive value under the balance column. There is slippage
        because accounts that have staked less than 100 FUND are not considered.</p>
