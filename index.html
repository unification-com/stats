    $dataAccounts24H$
    <p>The changes to account balances are due to UND spent, staking rewards explicitly withdrawn, deposits spent or
        returned on proposals.
    </p>

    <p>Negative accrued rewards are rewards
        that have been withdrawn, and will reflect as a positive value under the balance column. There is slippage
        because accounts that have staked less than 100 UND are not considered.</p>
